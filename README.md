# ⚡ Realtime Collaborative Code Editor

A **realtime collaborative code editor** built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**, allowing multiple users to write, edit, and run code together instantly — just like Google Docs for code!

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Realtime Collaboration** – Multiple users can edit code simultaneously.  
✅ **Multiple Languages** – Supports JavaScript, Python, C++, Java (via compiler APIs or backend runner).  
✅ **Syntax Highlighting** – Powered by Monaco Editor (the same editor used by VS Code).  
✅ **Room System** – Create or join coding rooms via unique room IDs.  
✅ **Live Cursor & Changes** – See other users’ cursors and edits in real time.  
✅ **Run Code Instantly** – Execute code and view output in the integrated terminal/output window.  
✅ **Beautiful UI** – Clean, modern interface built with React + TailwindCSS.  
✅ **Scalable Backend** – Uses Socket.IO for bi-directional communication and Express for REST endpoints.
